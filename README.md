# Project Two the Seattle Cheeseburger Finder
The Seattle Cheeseburger Finder pulls restaurant data from the Yelp API and allows you to save personal comments in a user profile. Use it to catalog good and bad burgers or save places you would like to check out for a later date. 

You can find this side deployed on [Heroku](https://seattle-cheeseburgers.herokuapp.com/).

## Technical Requirements
- Have at least 2 models
- Include sign up/log in functionality, with hashed passwords & an authorization flow
- Incorporate at least one API. Examples include Yelp, Tumblr, Facebook, and others on Mashape.
- Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
- Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data
- Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
- Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public

## User Stories
User 1: Mary who is visiting Seattle for the first time in a couple of months and really enjoys cheeseburgers. She would like to research the area and save restaurants in an easy to access profile for reference during her trip.

User 2: Luke, who loves cheeseburgers but gets confused on which is his favorite burger and which restaurant he enjoyed that burger at. Luke would like to save comments about his burger findings in Seattle, Wa so he doesn't end up wasting money on a buger he has already tried.
